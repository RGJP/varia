                Simply click the 'Explore' button to receive a random mudra from a library of over 50 options.
                Practicing mudras is simple: get in a comfortable position with your spine straight and your shoulders relaxed.
                Gently bring your fingers into the chosen mudra without straining—keep the touch light and natural.
                Close your eyes, breathe slowly and evenly, and hold the mudra for 5–15 minutes, or as long as feels comfortable.
                Stay focused on your breath and the energy or meaning of the mudra, allowing your mind to calm.
                Consistency matters more than duration, so practicing regularly—even daily—can help you experience the benefits more deeply.
